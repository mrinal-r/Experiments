# Deep Learning Project Report

[3 points] Effort to curate/create your dataset (at least a thousand records/images)
Preprocessing (e.g. lowering resolution), cleaning, data summary
Outliers analysis
Data augmentation (if needed)


[3 points] Effort to visualize input data
Example, draw plots, visualize all images in groups
Novel visualizations/plots can get you bonus points. For example, plots involving 3 or 4 columns


[3 points] Effort correctly split data into 3 sets
Randomization



[3 points] Effort to design and test various neural network architectures
Why did you choose the architecture you chose?
How does the performance change if linear regression or logistic regression is used?



[3 points] Effort to evaluate your results
Discussion of predictability of your model on the data you used



[3 points] Effort to benchmark your method / results
Comparison with state-of-the-art methods



[3 points] Documentation efforts (report preparation)
Documentation of all steps above



[3 points] Effort to document the training time
Relationship between training time, epochs, dataset size



[3 points] Effort to study learning curves
Plots of epoch vs loss on training / validation datasets


[3 points] Effort to prepare a "reproducible" Python Notebook (.ipynb) file
a Readme.txt file that outlines the steps for reproducing everything
Hosting online is encouraged (such as GitHub)
